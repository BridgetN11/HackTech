        <h1>Greenscaping</h1>
        <p>One of the best way to ensure you are protecting your immediate environment and ecosystems is by practicing greenscaping on any land you own or manage. Greenscaping is the practice of simultaneously improving the condition of one's land while simultaneously protecting the ecosystems and natural life around it. </p>
        <p>Greenscaping is a great way to ensure that natural enviornments in populated areas can still be maintained. It can protect native species, prevent runoff from contaminating water sources, and lead to better health and wellbeing for individuals living in communities practicing greenscaping. Some ways to start on your greenscaping journey can include:</p>

        <div id="grid-item2"><img src="leaf.png" alt="logo"></div>
        <div id="grid-item3"><img src="trees.png" alt="logo"></div>
        <div id="grid-item4">Grow plants that are safe for and local to the local ecosystems. Plants that are native to your area will minimize the risk of harmfully invasive plant and animal species. Furthermore, native plants like wildflowers or fruits can promote the health of native pollinators. This can also iimprove the liveliness and greenery in your gardens.</div>
        <div id="grid-item5">Use safe fertilizers that won't harm waterways or wildlife. Many fertilizers contain chemicals that are poisonous to local wildlife. These fertilizers are damaging when sprayed on plants, but their danger is multiplied when the chemicals flow into water sources for animals and humans, making these sources potentially toxic.</div>
        <div id="grid-item6">Donâ€™t over-water plants or crops. While over-watering can be harmful to plants, it is also harmful to the local environment, as over watering can catalyze the movement of fertilizer chemicals and pesticides. Furthermore,  over-consuming water for landscaping and gardening can have negative effects on the larger community, especially in times of drought, where the local reservoir can either run dry or be filled with harmful chemicals from runoff. </div>
