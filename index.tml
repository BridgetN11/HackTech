          <p>In many different industries, sustainable practices in production can be marked by a stamp of seal indicating that it has gone through an eco-friendy process or evaluation, and these can be halpful in deciding which products to purchase when looking for a greener option.</p>

          <img src="rrricon.webp" alt="RRR symbol">
          <p>Another great way to maintain an eco-friendly lifestyle is to uphold conscious consumerism by understanding the lifecycle of products they consume and where they might end up. While cliché, the “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle” phrase remains important in growing sustainable practices in everyday lives. Rampant consumerism an overproduction is one of the primary factors of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Practicing each of the “three R’s” will lead to less landfill waste and less energy consumption in the production of new product and transport of trash.</p>

          <h2>Sustainable Transportation</h2>
          <img src="csucarbonchart.jpeg" alt="Carbon chart">
          <p>While it may not be easy to find accessible and eco-friendly transportation options, reducing the need for vehicles that run on fossil fuels can significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions and slow the effects of global warming. Rather than driving a car, try finding public transportation, and if a close enough distance, try biking or walking instead! Did you know it causes more carbon to be emitted into the atmosphere to travel by horse rather than public bus? Take a look at the graphic from Colorado State University to see how your go-to transit method compared to other method in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. The more you understand the effects of the transit you choose, the more sustainable choices you can make in the future.</p>
